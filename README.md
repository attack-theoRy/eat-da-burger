## Description

This is a full-stack app that uses Node.js, MySQL, Express routes, express handlebars and heroku to add and then log burgers you have eaten from a database. You start by either adding your own burger to the list using the submit form or by devouring what's already there.

The app can be found with no installation needed on heroku at :  https://still-garden-09395.herokuapp.com/
Or to use through terminal do the following:
To use properly you need to install Node.js and in the terminal you have to use the command
